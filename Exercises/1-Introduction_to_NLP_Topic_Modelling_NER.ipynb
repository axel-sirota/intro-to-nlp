Unfortunately, most data science techniques require numeric data. NLP libraries provide a tool set of methods to convert unstructured text into meaningful numeric data.\n","\n","- **Analysis:** NLP techniques provide tools to allow us to understand and analyze large amounts of text. For example:\n","\n","    - Analyze the positivity/negativity of comments on different websites.\n","    - Extract key words from meeting notes and visualize how meeting topics change over time.\n","\n","- **Vectorizing for machine learning:** When building a machine learning model, we typically must transform our data into numeric features. This process of transforming non-numeric data such as natural language into numeric features is called vectorization. For example:\n","\n","    - Understanding related words. Using stemming, NLP lets us know that \"swim\", \"swims\", and \"swimming\" all refer to the same base word. This allows us to reduce the number of features used in our model.\n","    - Identifying important and unique words.
